# StarterProject

## Purpose

The two main purposes of the Starter Project are:

### Make our code more robust with modular approach

- Think modules, not pages
- Examples of modules are: navigation, header, footer, contact form, social widgets, info-box, button, breadcrumbs
- A module should not depend on any external CSS and JS
- A module cannot overwrite any external CSS and JS (use namespaces, for example prefix all CSS with .modulename, and use module pattern in JS)
- A module should not know its position and (ideally) dimensions. This way you can place a module anywhere on the page grid.

### Shorten the learning curve by standardizing the project structure

- Starter Project comes with initial files and folders
- It makes it easier to start on a new project
- When new developers join the project, they are familiar with the project structure and can quickly get up to speed with the project
